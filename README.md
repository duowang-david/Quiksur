# Welcome to Quisur!<br /><br />


Quisur is a simple application written in Python to create and conduct quick survey. <br />
Use Quiksur.py in Quiksur_App folder to run Quiksur application.<br />
The documentation file demonstrates essential functionalities of Quiksur. <br /><br />


In order to load the logo image, you need to import PIL library, which sometimes doesn't work properly. <br />If this happens, you can alternatively use Quiksur-no logo.py, which is Quiksur without showing its logo.
